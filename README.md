# Libra Checker

[Libra Checker](https://librachecker.com) is a Libra cryptocurrency block explorer.

This repository is the source code for the Libra Checker's frontend (Vue.js app).

To run your own instance of Libra Checker, you also need the other two parts:

[/libra-checker-grpc](https://github.com/librastartup/libra-checker-grpc) - Node.js gRPC client + Python/JavaScript LCS to fetch and deserialize transactions.

[/libra-checker-api](https://github.com/librastartup/libra-checker-api) - Express.js API to connect backend with frontend.
